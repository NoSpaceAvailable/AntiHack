# Note
- This extension is supported on Chromium-based browsers, but I only tested on Edge and Brave üòÅ
- Window defender will detect it as malware, due to `manifest.json` file inside my project. You can try to turn it off for a while.

# Bug & bypass
- This project is for fun so no bounty for uüò• Please kindly report to my discord: `nospaceavailable` if you found any. Thanks^^
- I can't prevent user from uninstalling the extension because of the browser's security policy. Hide it from your friends:))))
